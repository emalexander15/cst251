	<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>

		<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>The idea of this lab is to become familiar with "div", learn how to create different
				 types of forms such as textboxes, passwords, select, radios, and checkboxes along with a submit button,
	  		 introduce yourself to css files and linking them within your website,
				 and as always testing your files locally before uploading them to the server.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>The main challenges I encountered involved the radio vs. checkbox insertions from forms. I was able to
				 get them working correctly, but I decided to change the order and once I did that the radio buttons would no
			   longer appear. After looking over my code, I realized I did not include the input type tags, so once I resolved
			 	 this issue it worked. What I am currently battling with now is a radio button appearing next to my "Select Your Language"
			 	 selection boxes. Monica and I looked over my code and are unable to find the issue. I would also like to find out how
			 the height of the border through the css can be manually sized depending on the amount of text or zooming in/out rather
			 than changing the #vh.</p>
	<h2>Results:</h2>
	<h4>We are looking at my results!</h4>
			<p>I was successfully able to input an image, create the forms and have all of them work correctly, and begin
				 to understand the css stylesheet as well as embed it into my code which can be seen on my website, thank you
			 	 Wes for starting the index.css for us as from there I knew what to do. I also added centering for my text as
				 well as image, but I would like to know how to indent the centered lists towards the left so they look more balanced
				 when centered due to being different lengths.</p>
