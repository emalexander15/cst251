	<h1>purpose</h1>
	     <p>The purpose of this lab is to stylize the text elements by changing the font,
         colors, letter-spacing, and using text transform. To go even further, also
         inputting Google fonts into our headings rather than the CSS web safe fonts.</p>

    <div id="challenges">
  <h1>challenges</h1>
			 <p>I did not encounter any challenges for the required tasks. I have already been
         changing my fonts as well as changing colors for the background and texts in
         different ids. I have been using the color codes rather than names since the
         beginning of this class, but am now trying to understand the (RGB). </p>

	<h3>We are looking at my results!</h3>
			 <p>I was successfuly able to change my font from 'Didot' to 'Arial/Arial Black' as an easy read
         (although I am going to be changing it back to 'Didot' to keep the flow of my page consistent
         and I am more fond of it). I also changed my purpose, challenges, and results boxes to a different
         type color which were the product of lighter/darker shades of my background color RosyBrown
         (specifically at 95% and 65%). I also inputted the text transform of 'uppercase' for my headings
         as before I was just doing it manually and letter spacing '12px' for headings and '2px' for body.</p>
