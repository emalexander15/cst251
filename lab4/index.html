	<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to test our files both locally and through the server.
			The objective was to make sure our coding in Atom worked through our browser with the correct headings, paragraphs,
			links, and images. Once we finished modifying our files, we went into GitHub and committed our changes to master and pushed
		to origin where our html would appear as our username for GitHub rather than our local html in the search bar. Ultimately,
	we publish our html to the web through the cst251 repo.</p>

	<h1>CHALLENGES</h1>
		<p>Creating the index.html, testing our files locally, configuring our GitHub desktop client, and modifying
			our files was quite simplistic. We already practice testing our files locally after creating an html through "view
			in browser" in order to check if our code worked correctly, and we had done the GitHub clientel in class, but the Challenge
			was publishing it to the web. I committed all of my changes in my homepage and individual labs to master and pushed to origin,
			but when viewing in my browser the search bar html still came up as my local location. Instead of "emalexander15.github.io/cst251"
			it comes up as "file:///Users/emmaalexander/Desktop/school/college/cst-251/cst251/homepage.html" I went back into GitHub and made sure
			I correctly followed the guidelines, which I seemed to have done, so am unsure what to do, as well as Monica.
			<br>
			<br> Update: We were incorrectly looking up our websites by forgetting to add "/index.html".</p>
