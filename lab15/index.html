	<h1>RESULTS</h1>
	<h3>We are looking at my results!</h3>
			 <p>I was successfuly able to implement at least one example of each of
         the listed css style techniques. I used "text-shadow" in my title,
         "box-shadow" in my first and third text boxes, "gradient" as my
         background color for my html, "filters" in turning my image black and
         white as well as hovering making the original color version blur,
         "rounded-corners" in my second text box, "object-fit" in cropping my
         image from 360px to 350px and a height of 500px, and lastly "transform"
         in rotating both my image and it's background color.</p>
