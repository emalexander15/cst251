	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	     <p>The purpose of this lab was to further develop our last prototypes into three concise
       ideas we have for a finalized website model. We gathered feedback from our teams and took
       the most favored concepts given to us as well as went more into depth with layouts and
       positioning of the html.</p>

  <h1>Challenges</h1>
			 <p>The challenges I encountered were mainly distinguishing which positioning would look best for
        each of my elements.</p>

	<h3>Look below for my final sketches!</h3>
			 <p>I was successfuly able to create 9 sketches of 3 different prototype ideas for the final website.
        My most favored idea is the last design with a flexbox layout and individualized links in a sidebar
        to lead to our playlists.</p>
