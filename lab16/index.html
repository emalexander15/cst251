	<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
	     <p>The purpose of this lab was to continue to experiment with more "fancy"
         css styling. We added more intricate backgrounds, were introduced to transitions
         and animation, as well as learned how to add columns to separate our chosen text.</p>

    <div id="challenges">
  <h1>CHALLENGES</h1>
			 <p>I encountered problems when it came to animating my div with different
         colors as part of the animation segment. Luckily Monica was able to help
         me as I had not separated my divs originally. One extra thing I tried
         to figure out but was unable to was lowering the opacity of just my div's
         background gif as when I tried it affected the text too. For now, I just
         added a text shadow so you can see the text a bit clearer.</p>

	<h1>RESULTS</h1>
    <div id="look">
	<h3>Look! (Hover Over Me)</h3>
    </div>
			 <p>I was successfuly able to add backgrounds (my spooky skeletons dancing)
         in my text box rather than my whole webpage, add transitions in the scaling
         of my title and transforming my h3 element above when hovering over,
         color changing animation in my links section at the bottom of my page,
         and lastly columns.</p>
