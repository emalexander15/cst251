	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	     <p>The purpose of this lab was to create div id and classes for floating, centering,
         and centering horizontal/vertical text and images to explore how to place objects
         in different areas on our webpage.</p>

    <div id="challenges">
  <h1>Challenges</h1>
			 <p>The only challenge I encountered was in the last step of task 2. I was struggling
         with centering my image both horizontally and vertically as it kept appearing
         horizontally like my previous image. But, today in class Wes went over it and I had
         not known what the "transform: translate" feature was and how it needed to be added.</p>

    <div id="results">
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<h3>We are looking at my results!</h3>
			 <p>I was successfuly able to place my text and images using the float right feature and
         centering in both horizontal and vertical ways. Each of my boxes are 500px in order to
         illustrate the visual differences in my centered images as the tasks called for.</p>
