      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this lab was to sketch a CSS layout then execute it through
          our code. We then went further using CSS flexbox, a new layout mode, which
          ensures the container will change accomodate differing device screen sizes.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>The challenges I encountered when doing this lab involved whatever element
        I put at the top of my page, the css would not appear. After a couple tries, I
        just put two breaks at the start of the page so it would break this. I also had
        an issue with the sections, but then separated them into their own divs. I am now
        struggling with making my page capable of scrolling without inserting a multitude
        of breaks.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <h4>you are looking at them!</h4>
      <p>I was successfully able to execute the layout I had sketched on paper with
          incorporating sticky, fixed, and float positioning as well as get all of
          my links to work. I also went to w3schools to learn how to properly create
          thumbnail images with a hover highlight.</p>
