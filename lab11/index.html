	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	     <p>The purpose of this lab was to create different div ids and stylize them with block styles,
         specific width/height and position, and introduce the concepts of magic positions with the "sticky"
         feature.</p>

  <h1>Challenges</h1>
			 <p>The only challenge I had encountered involved the float of my div contents, they would
         overlap over each other. After looking over my code, I figured out I needed to add breaks
         in between each and delete the margin auto. I used float because I could not figure out the
         "aside" id for the sidebar.</p>
