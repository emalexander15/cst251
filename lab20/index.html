	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	     <p>The purpose of this lab was to create a series of prototype designs for our website
          topic to later show our team members and recieve feedback. The sketches were to be
          done quickly and we will later narrow down our ideas to three final detailed prototypes.</p>

  <h1>Challenges</h1>
			 <p>The challenges I encountered were thinking of different design concepts for the same topic. Our
          playlist idea is pretty straight forward, but it was hard to think of different design concepts
          as there is only so many ways you can have a model of a playlist like Spotify or Apple Music.</p>

	<h3>Look below for my prototypes!</h3>
			 <p>I was successfuly able to create 15 sketches of 5 different prototype ideas. I drew concepts for the
          title page having statistics or links to our playlists as well as a nav bar which directs the viewer
          to our playlists. I also came up with ideas for our individual subtopic pages and how to layout the
          playlist.</p>
