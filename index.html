  <h1>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h1>
	<p>Hello! My name is Emma Alexander. I am a second year student studying
    at California State University, Monterey Bay.	I am a Communication Design
    major with a concentration in Visual Design and a minor in Business. I am
    from Southern California in a small beach city known as San Clemente. Aside
    from designing my hobbies include photography, spending time with friends,
    going to the beach, and traveling. If I'm not at the beach, shopping at the mall,
    or folding clothes at work you can find me in my bed taking a nap or watching Netflix.
    My aspirations for the future of my career include designing logos, flyers, posters,
    or social media posts for an array of companies, such as in the fashion or beauty spectrum.
    I am grateful to continue learning more about designing and marketing and look forward to
    what is to come in the future for me. This is my website for my CST 251 web design course,
    enjoy!</p>
