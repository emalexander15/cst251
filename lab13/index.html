	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	     <p>The purpose of this lab was to recreate a fake website based on the examples
          given to us in iLearn. The focus was on the typography choices, so we recreated
          an html with similar typography in fonts, color, and style, as well as other components
          such as the imagery or style of the page itself.</p>

  <h1>Challenges</h1>
			 <p>The challenges Monica and I encountered included finding a close enough font to the website of our choice
          as well as implementing a background image. After trying different techniques we went on to w3schools and
          read their tutorial in both the html and css. We decided our main problem was inputting a local url rather
          than from the web, so we found a sunset building image similar to that of the website on the web, used that link,
          credited the photographer, and it worked. As for our fonts, we knew the closest paragraph font was the google font
          'Playfair Display' so using previous knowledge on how to code google fonts we were able to do so. As for the
          date '2020' we tried an array of sans-serif fonts and thought 'Trebuchet MS' was our best bet.</p>

	<h1>Results</h1>
	<h3>Look below for our results!</h3>
			 <p>We were successfully able to "fake" the website of our choice in similar background images,
         style of text in both colors and fonts, and input working links in each of the corners as seen
         in the original site.</p>
