    2020, the year the world went to chaos. There were instances of brutality, protests,
    death, a pandemic, climate change, an influx of fires on the West Coast,
    skies of orange, and the presidential election. In the town of Los Angeles,
    luckily the Lakers brought home a championship for Kobe and the buildings are
    shown to still be standing and the sun shining down on them.
