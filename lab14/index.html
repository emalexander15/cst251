	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	     <p>The purpose of this lab was to recreate a more complicated fake website based on the examples
          given to us in iLearn. The focus was on the typography choices, so we recreated an html with
          similar typography in fonts, color, and style, as well as other components such as the imagery
          or style of the page itself.</p>

    <div id="challenges">
  <h1>Challenges</h1>
			 <p>The challenges Monica and I encountered included once again the background image on her laptop. As
          we have not yet learned how to stack text, we created the background in Photoshop. We figured out the
          issue once transferring to my laptop regarding using local files for images rather than the link was not
          adding the ../img after the url. Other than that we did not encounter any other struggles.</p>

    <div id="results">
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<h3>Look below for our results!</h3>
			 <p>We were successfully able to "fake" a more complicated website of our choice in the background color/type, the same
          font usage as the original website, creating an opacity effect with the paragraph, positioning the type in the same
          way, and inputting a logo as well as horizontally even title. Again, I am unsure as to why the frame below makes
          our page appear oddly cropped so I also added the link.</p>
