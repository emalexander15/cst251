		<h1 style="color:#BC8F8F;">A Little About Me</h1>
		<p style="color:#BC8F8F;">Hello! My name is Emma Alexander
			I am a second year student studying
			at California State University, Monterey Bay.
			I am a Communication Design major with a
			concentration in Visual Design. I am from
			Southern California in a small beach city
			known as San Clemente. Aside from designing
			my hobbies include photography, spending time with
			friends, going to the beach, and traveling. If I'm
			not at the beach, shopping at the mall, or folding
			clothes at work you can find me in my bed taking a nap
			or watching Netflix. My aspirations for the future of my
			career include designing logos, flyers, posters, or social
			media posts for an array of companies, such as in the
			fashion and beauty spectrum. I also hope to minor in
			Business Marketing where I can learn marketing strategies
			that will be helpful in my career.</p>
