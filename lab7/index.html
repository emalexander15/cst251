	<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
	     <p>The idea of this lab is to explore more of the world of CSS and become familiar
         with it's uses and implementing it into each of our lab html.index for our website.
         In this lab, we go more into the importance of "div" class tags and using an "id"
         on images. For this lab we are specifically stylizing our margins, border around
         images, and background color. Finally, we test our html locally as well as debug
         before committing our changes to the server for the world to see.</p>

  <h1>CHALLENGES</h1>
			 <p>The only challenges I encountered were originally with putting the borders around my div classes.
         Originally when doing so, the borders would not end and they all connected with one another.
         I will place an image below showcasing this issue. When I went back into my code, I realized
         I had not closed each div class with "/div". Once I closed each out, and included breaks after
         each border, my website looked more balanced with each border. I cannot find out how to change the
         width of the borders under the div# in my css, so for my image I just inputted the border under the
         "img" css. But, in the future if I want to put multiple images, how will I change one from having the
         same border? Also, how can I put a border around the whole page without disrupting the other "divs"
         as you need to close it and it doesn't specify the class itself?</p>

	<h1>RESULTS</h1>
	<h2>We are looking at my results!</h2>
			 <p>I was successfully able to upload my index.css into my html, use div class and id tags, stylize
         my font, background and font colors, put borders around my different text sections under their div
         class, and change their background colors. I kept each of my div's padding's at 50px aside in order
         to keep the flow.</p>
