	<div id="purpose">
			<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
				<p>The idea of this lab is to embed more images
			onto our website in our lab 5 html document and be able to name and place the files correctly.
			Furthermore, to also add links to our document or images that can successfully
			take us to another site or page such as to a social media platform of ours.</p>

			<h1>CHALLENGES</h1>
				<p>The first challenge I encountered when completing this lab was
			the "link one of your images to another site." At first, my link was appearing but the image space
			was blank with a question mark. Monica later informed me I had to also include the img src in my own
			lab 5 img folder in order for it to show, as well as I forgot to include the img/ in the coding. Other
			than that, I was able to upload my first two images, my original Instagram link of my personal account
			(it is private so I screenshotted two images from it and still included my bio page) as well as the Sorority
			photo and link as it is a public account and easy to access/ run by me. The last challenge both Monica and I cannot
			seem to figure out is linking our homepage html. We followed the correct coding, and the link appears, but when you click
			it nothing comes up.
<br>
			<br>Update: We were informed we incorrectly coded it and needed to put "../index.html". Now our homepage link at the bottom works correctly.
			<br>Local vs. Server Link Update: My website was successfully published.</p>
